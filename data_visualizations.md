## What colleges are reporting based on Clery Act data

The following visualizations were generated from the Clery Act data starting from 2009 to 2017 with the following stipulations:

- All institutions that did not report any crimes for a specific year were not counted for that year.
- The institution must be counted by the federal government as a four year institution.
- Only main campus crimes were included.

This process is known to not be perfect as there are institutions that should not be in this dataset. Unfortunately, due to the sheer volume of data, each report could not be individually verfied by the researchers.
