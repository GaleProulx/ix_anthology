## This Option Closes February 29th at Midnight

Whether you aren't a confident writer, don't have the energy to write, or simply don't want to spend that much time on a (possibly) difficult subject, then consider taking us up on our interview/ghostwriting submission option. We are very passionate about this subject and want to give *everyone* the chance to submit. Which means understanding that writing ability and confidence shouldn't determine if someone can share their story.

By signing up for this process, you would be agreeing to share your story via an interview with one of our ghost writers. Once the ghostwriter feels they have a good handle on your story, they will then write the piece for you.

Unlike with normal submissions, this process will take a couple of extra back and forths. To start, you (the storyteller) and your ghostwriter will converse back a forth a couple of times. This will give you and your writer a chance to make sure they’re accurately representing your story. Then, like with any piece submitted to us, we will do a few rounds of edits, a process both you and your writer will be a part of.

This process may take longer than a normal submission would, but we want these stories to be as true to you as possible.

Due to our small staff and number of volunteers, you will not be able to pick your ghostwriter. With that said, if you would feel more comfortable talking to a specific gender, we will do our absolute best to honor that request. On a similar note, if at **any** point you feel uncomfortable with your ghostwriter or believe they aren’t doing your story the justice it deserves, let us know! If time allows, we will assign a new writer to you to either start from scratch or alter what’s already been written.

If this sounds like an option you would be interested in, email us at [theixanthology@gmail.com](mailto: theixanthology@gmail.com).
