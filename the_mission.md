## Why we are here

We've lived on Champlain College's campus for almost four years. That's around a fifth of our lives. We’ve heard about more occurrences of sexual violence (and therefore Title IX Violations) in these last few years than we had at any other point in our lives. This may not sound surprising to you; the fact of the matter is that college campuses are a breeding ground for sexual misconduct. And more often than not, these violations aren't reported. Why? Because even when they are, even when the survivor gives up their privacy and comfort to allow for a "full investigation," there is rarely a definitive outcome. And an even slimmer chance of any disciplinary action being taken against the perpetrator. In our personal experience, and in all of the reported and unreported cases we’ve heard about, there have been *zero* expulsions. *Zero* student housing rights revoked. *Nothing.*

Frankly, we’ve been witness to more survivors leaving the college than perpetrators.

Based on a study done by Dr. Bazle Hossain, it's estimated that 20-25% of college-age women experience sexual violence. Out of the ~2,000 students on our campus, only 0.09% have reported a Title IX violation.

This information tells us a few things:

First, our society needs a new and better way of teaching sex and consent. Thankfully, there are lot of people and organizations out there working on this.

Second, more sexual violence and Title IX studies need to include men and non-bianary folx.

And lastly, if no one is reporting the violations, then there is *something* about the system which keeps survivors from reaching out and seeking justice.

That's what *IX Anthology* is here to do; figure out what isn't working within our Title IX system in hopes of changing it for the better.

The goal of this anthology is to blend human stories with indisputable data and facts in order to paint a full-picture of the experience many survivors go through on college campuses. We want to take the large, country wide data we've collected about Title IX violations and show the individual stories that go towards creating this data, and it's imbalance.
