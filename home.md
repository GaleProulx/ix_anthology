## No Student’s Education Should be Jeopardized for Seeking Justice.

We’re IX, a nonfiction anthology whose goal is to bring to light the truth behind the Title IX process on college campuses. We wish to blend human stories with indisputable data and facts to paint a full picture of the experience many survivors go through. By taking both the large, country wide data we've collected about Title IX violations and zooming way in to show the individual stories that go towards creating this data, we hope to highlight the pitfalls of the system and possibly help change it.

Since the #MeToo movement, sexual violence and assault has gotten more attention than it ever has. More people are stepping forward and sharing their stories, breaking down stereotypes, and continuing the conversation. With that said, we still have a long way to go.

Like when it comes to legal processes, such as Title IX. Much like the standard legal practices that come with a sexual violence case, the Title IX process can be invasive and embarrassing for every party involved. And even after going through this process and the investigations, rarely is any disciplinary action taken.
Which is probably one reason why even though 20-25 perecnt of college age women are thought to expereince sexual violence, only about 0.09 percent of all students on Champlain’s campus have reported a Title IX violation over the last eight years (statistic about women from Dr. Bazle Hossain from Morgan State University | Champlain statistic from Clery Act data).

(Side note: though we included reports from all students on Champlain’s campus, most research on Title IX and sexual violence is female-focused. This in itself is a huge issue.)

We want to change this. Because we believe no student's education should be jeopardized for seeking justice.


If this mission interests you, consider submitting to us! We have a few different submission options, including an interview/ghostwriting option should you have a story you wish to tell, but lack the confidence as a writer. We also have a quick survey anyone can fill out, whether you've had an experience with Title IX or not. We would be beyond grateful if you took the time to look at it.

Click around the website to learn more about our mission, our submission options and guidelines, and the story behind the data. And, if you have no idea what Title IX even is, we've got a page for that too!
