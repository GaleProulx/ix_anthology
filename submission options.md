## Standard Submission Guidelines

### Standard Submissions Close March 15th at Midnight

IX Anthology is a creative nonfiction collection whose focus is on the Title IX process on college campuses. Whether you were directly involved in a Title IX case or simply saw the impact it had on a close friend or family member, we want to hear your stories (with consent from the person involved, of course)! This process is deeply flawed, and we want to bring attention to it.

When it comes to your submission, we want it to focus on your experience with the Title IX process. How much or little of the violation you include in your piece is up to you, but the goal of our anthology is to point out the flaws within the system itself.

Think about questions such as: Why did you (or your friend) report the incident and how did the school handle it? Did you follow through with a full investigation? What sort of disciplinary actions were taken against the perpetrator? What sort of push-back did you face as the reporter?

As a creative nonfiction anthology, we accept: essays, short memoirs, nonfiction flash pieces, poetry, and even experimental forms (as long as it's readable).

Our focus is on Champlain College specifically, but we're open to outside submissions as well.

If you're interested in submitting, but aren't confident with your writing, check out our Interview/Ghost Writing option. This is an important topic and we don't believe writing ability should hinder anyone's ability to share their story.

Simultaneous submissions are allowed, but it’s your responsibility to let us know if your piece is accepted elsewhere.

Due to legal reasons, we will not be including any names in the anthology. When submitting to us, you may include your name and any other information you wish, but be aware it will not be seen in the anthology. You may also submit anonymously (for details, see instructions below).

Submission Instructions:
Work must be in .docx or .pdf format.
Submissions must be in 12pt Times New Roman font.
Only one submission per person allowed (see specifications based on form below)
Prose submissions -
Can be anywhere from 200-1,000 words.
Must be double spaced.
If writing flash, you may submit as many flash pieces as you'd like, as long as their total word count does not exceed the 1,000 word limit. Include them all within the same document.
Poetry/Experimental -
Any line spacing allowed, as long as it's readable.
You may submit as many poems/short forms as you like, as long as their total word count doesn’t exceed 1,000 or your total page count does not exceed 4 pages. Submit all poems in the same document.
Due to our focus, by law submissions may not include any personal information concerning any party member. This includes names, dorm specifications, or any other information that could be used to discern identity.
To submit, email us at theixanthology@gmail.com. As stated previously, you may include as little or as much personal information in this email as you’d like. If submitting anonymously, feel free to create a fake gmail account and just send us the file (please keep said email active so we may contact you about your submission).
When submitting, title your file simply with the title of the piece.

By submitting your work, you agree to give IX Anthology First North American Serial Rights (FNASR) (if previously unpublished), archival rights, and the right to reproduce work for promotional purposes upon acceptance.

We also encourage everyone - and we mean everyone - to fill out our survey. A big part of our project is using data to show the imbalances caused by Title IX, but we can't do that without, you know, data.
